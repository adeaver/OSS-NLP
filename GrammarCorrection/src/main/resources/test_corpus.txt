In modern digital world electronic products are widely used in daily lives such as Smart phones computers and etcIn work places electronic devices such as computers are also inevitable to use to increase the productivity of the corporationThe convenience and high efficiency of using electronic products is being noticed by people worldwideSome people started to think if electronic products can be further operated to more advanced utilization and replace human beings for better performancesSurveillance technology such as RFID is one type of examples that has currently been implementedIn this essay I will discuss that if surveillance technology such as RFID should be used or not to track peoplePersonally I agree to a large extent that surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track peopleI do not agree on this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track peopleIn this fast moving society technology is always improving to catch up the fast pace of this world and most surveillance technology is used by the police or other army usage to track people downAlthough the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy it has also brought us lots of benefits and securityThere are two points supporting this argumentFirstly security systems are improved in many areas such as school campus or at the workplaceSecondly it makes it possible for parents to track their children and also their elderly parentsTherefore this technology should be used to track peopleSurveillance technology is getting more and more widely used with the development of modern technology in terms of various scientific breakthroughsAnd after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life products such as RFID tracking system have become realRFID is not only used to track products for logistical and storage purpose it is also used to track people by doing human implantsIt is unacceptable for some people in the society however I think this application is necessary and provides the society a lot of benefitAs the technology increasingly advances many of things that are regarded as impossible are turning into the 'possibles'From internet email to the most powerful surveillance technology every step is advancement to not only the society but also the world 's achievementsPeople 's lives become from increasingly convenient to almost luxury thanks to the implementation of increasingly technology available for the Man 's lifeHowever such rapid advancement technology though can be extremely useful to our daily life it can also cause the invisible or massive threats to our peaceful livings that can be out of our imaginations and estimationsRFID is used in many forms for example transportation homes and even officesOver these years it had help humans to improve the accessibility in the forms of cards to gain access to certain placesOther than using it on these areas it is also been used as human implant or as a form of productsThese implants and products are also been used as surveillance toolsFor using as a surveillance tool it could also be used in terms of surveys and statisticsThere are also medical tools that are more of implant into the human body for the basic medical researchMoreover the use of RFID chip in tracking clothes were also very common sight in the service industry for the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked the location of it at any one pointI think that surveillance technology such as RFID can be used to track peopleNowadays with the rapid development of science and technology the emerging technologies always contribute to human beings better living conditionsFor example the Internet has abridged the distance among people globallyAlthough we have to admit some bad effect which is brought up by the new technology still the advantages of the new technologies cannot be simply discardedBack to the surveillance technology people may say it leaks their privacy or personal lifeCompared to this disadvantage we should think about what the advantages it has make available for human beingsIt can provide a safe convenient identifiable environmentI do not agree with the above statementIn my opinion surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people though there do exist many problems if it prevailsThis can help to regulate people 's behavior control crime and prevent terrorism and set up demographic dataAs technology becomes more advanced nowadays people are very exposed to the various types of technology in their daily livesIt is undeniable that technology has made ours lives and works easier and more efficientHowever when surveillance technology starts to violet the privacy of people instead of being used in a more benefitial way towards people it is my opinion that such technology should rethink its way of existenceTechnology advancement is extremely fast nowadaysSurveillance technology is one of the main concerns of military and national defense sectorsExample of this technology is RFID which has been proposed to track people through various means such as human implants or RFID tags on peopleHowever this proposal has led to fierce argument in the world over its pros and consI personally stand together with the population who reject the proposalNowadays the improved human technology online is able to track different location for different peopleFor instance face book as the well known social media platform has the ability of tracking someone 's locationHowever in some opinions these auto tracking services break the rule of privacySome people do not want to be tracked as they feel it is not safeIn my opinion the developed surveillance technology can be used to track people and objects only if the tracked person agrees to receive this serviceThe increasing in population of a country makes the government taking more difficulties of registers the members of each individual family and hence other factors existed as an obstacle of country developmentBy following the trend of improvement in technology people can now easily tracked by using RFID by simply implant a RFID tags on human bodyWith this advantage it will be easier for people to locate his friend or his family when they lost contact or in an urgent and also for police to investigate crimesNowadays technology is more advance than the past timeIn the past people only can find each other and communicate face to faceAfter the invention of phone and internet there are more ways to use to communicate with people and even track peopleIn this mean time surveillance technology is founded which mean that we are able to track people at every time in everywhereDefinitely there are point of view that agree the technology but also the voices of objectionThus let 's us discuss the pros and cons now to give you a clearer minds of surveillance technologyAs world pace becomes faster and faster the need for maximum efficiency becomes stronger and stronger in every fieldTo know where a certain item locates becomes one of the ways to improve efficiencyFor example UPS can track the process of each deliveryWith the information about the location of the cargo it is much easier to prevent unexpected loss and come up with more efficient plans to save the energy and resources of the companyRFID is one of the advanced technology for trackingDue to the small size of the equipment and the energy saving feature it becomes more and more popular in industries and logisticsHowever it is not a reasonable idea to use RFID to track people by human implants or RFID tags on daily products like watch or clothes it did provide convenience in a certain situationWith the developing of modern society more and more new technology appears and people 's life qualities rise because of the new inventionsSome good examples such as the Internet computers and satellites are now quite common for humans' normal life however some problems also emerge with a concern of the loss of the privacy of civiliansIn the modern society privacy is a hot topic in peoples' mindEven if the safety is the most important thing to consider in normal life many people still want to keep their privacy in spite of existing some potential dangerThe contradiction of the safety and the privacy cannot be reconciled perfectlyNowadays humans live in a modern societyAround people there are full of high technology like CCTVs automatically sorting system for goods and different information systemsIn order to bring more benefit and ensure people 's safety surveillance technology has been utilized in many aspects of fields like in UPs and DHL these express delivery companies use surveillance technology to track their goodsIt is convenient for customs to track and confirm where and how their goods are nowHowever besides tracking goods for people people begin to use this technology to track peopleI do not agree this kind of behavior because humans are different from goods cannot treat humans as goodsRadio frequency identification is a technology which uses a wireless non contact system to scan and transfer the data from a tag attached to people or products with radio frequency electromagnetic fieldAfter this it can automatically get the identification and trackingSurveillance technology should be used to track peopleThe technology is necessary because it can provide evidence in crime investigation and social issues and decrease the illegal actions effectivelySurveillance technology such as has been made possible to track people by implanting certain markers on people or productsThis is more than convenient for the authority to take better control of the society down to every individualHowever with respect of civil rights and privacy surveillance technology such as shall not be used to track peopleThere is one thing is common in the world described in many fiction chips are implanted in human and records its location history and even thoughts at that timeThe readers are just smiling when they flip the page because it never comes to their mind that one day it might come trueHowever the world is always beyond our imagination and never let us downActually this technology has already been weaved into our lifeAs the fast growing of electrical technology people have been trying to adopt more and more advanced technology into our life to make full use of itMany advantages have been shown in the areas like politicsBecause of the surveillance technology more and more things are under track and more and more clues can be usedHowever disadvantages have also been gradually disappeared as with the fruits people are enjoyingThat is to say there are more and more doubts raised by the public about the surveillance technologyFrom the view of my point I think the application should only be authorized by people in some specific fields like politics and public securitySurveillance technology such as Radio Frequency IdentificationIt should therefore not be used to track the population in order to protect people 's privacy and the idea of democracyWith the development of technology we have more advanced method to track people in today 's societySurveillance technology such as RFID is frequently used by the police to track people who are considered suspiciousHowever the using of surveillance technology is usually done secretly and a debate has been aroused today that whether surveillance technology should be abandonedSome socialists argue that installing surveillance device on people offends human rights and should be totally abandonedHowever people who are taking security job assert that surveillance technology is the most effective way to track people and make it easier for them to track those suspicious people so that they can do their work much more effectivelyIn my point of view surveillance technology should still be used to track people at present since there are no better solutionsIn the modern society public surveillance is becoming a normal phenomenonIn the United States after the horrible attack on September the US congress passed the Patriot Act which is mainly to increase domestic surveillance to counter against the terroristsHowever although these bureaucratic actions prevent another similar attack from happening again the act is widely criticized for its violation over individual privacyWith the development of surveillance technology such as RFID spy on the population can be much easier which will create even worse scenery for the citizensIn this paper the incorrectness of using technology such as RFID to track people will be proved by the discussion of violation of privacy the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian rule of the authorityWith the development of the science and technology people nowadays are living under various surveillances for example CCTVs can be seen almost everywhere in public areaRecently a new coming surveillance technology called radio frequency identification which is RFID for short has caused heated discussions on whether it should be used to track peopleSome people think RFID should be banned out of privacy considerationHowever As far as I am concerned using RFID to track specific people can be very helpful in situations such as scientific exploration rescue and police eventsWith the development of science and technology surveillance technology is playing its role in people 's lifesIt monitors anybody 's movement or activity and enables us to identify suspects involved in any misdoing which violates the law etcWhen surveillance technology like RFID brings lots of convenience to our life some people argue that this kind of technology actually makes us feel unsafePersonally I think surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track people for the benefit it brings to me cannot match the concerns it causesPopulation ageing is a global phenomenon as shown in China India Europe and even more countries and regionsStudies have shown that the current average life span is overProjections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at to annuallyThe rising expectancies are considered as a challenge as less workforce is resulted if population ages high burden for governments to support the sources of living for excessive ageing peopleHowever it is considered as an achievement as there is low competency in workforceRising life expectancies is a two sided sword which is both a challenge and an achievementWith the ageing population many countries are facing the same challenge as to build safety houses facilities to cater to the old agedAfter a certain age they will have to retireThe challenge of many ageing countries will rise when no new generation could take over their place in that particular tradeFirst I will discuss on the challenge of having an ageing population such as building more facilities and hospitals that will be needed when the population starts to age and jobs which have no young people taking over which can lead to economic downfallSecondly I will discuss the ageing population as an achievement where they implement healthy lifestyles and good eating habitsStudies have shown that the life span is getting longer which reflects the rising of life expectanciesIt is clear that population aging is happening all over the world since the current average life span is and the population above the age of is getting increased year after yearThis shows the rising of life expectancies it is an achievement and it is also a challengeAgeing population is a prolonged and persistent societal problem that is being frowned upon in most of the developed countriesAs the standard of living increases the affordability of high quality healthcare services and medical technologies which have advanced over the decades among the general public has become increasingly availablePeople of the nations are likely to be well taken care of partly because of the various healthcare incentives and schemes provided by the respective governmentIn the following I will take Singapore as the case study as a reference to my discussionThe rising of life expectancy globally can be challenging and yet an achievement when the problems of human could be medically disturbingThese few problems were taking a toll in human lives over the years when they were over years of ageMost of the illness lies with mental illness musculoskeletal pain and sight and hearing lossIt is a challenge where this illness can 't be easily avoided by any person in such a stressful lifestyle in any place in the worldMedical advances which help in curing this illness were also getting better over the year which helps in the rise in life expectancyRising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievementWe should separate it into two aspectsThe first one is that rising life expectancies can be considered as a challengeThe second one is that rising life expectancies can also be considered an achievementThey are not contradicting with each otherIn my opinion the challenge interception is to make comparison in the cross direction which is comparing the current situation with the assumed situationOn the other hand the achievement perceiving is to make comparison in the wire direction which is comparing the current situation with the historical situation in the pastSo in the following I will clarify these two different views for rising life expectanciesAs the world is at the turning point of entering into a stage where people are constantly and notably older than before how to make life easier comfortable as well as healthy has been shed light onLife expectancy is a figure that reveals the average lifetime and can be used as an indicator to measure up to what degree is the population ageing problemHowever there are situations where we have to consider the rising life expectancy as a challenge and an achievementIn recents decedes it is a trend that people are able to live a longer lifeThis is due to the improvements and breakthroughs in the realm of medication and people 's living conditionWhile it is applaudable that people achieved great success in prolonging their lives there are social challenges posted by the rising life expectanciesLife expectancy can be defined as desired level of service or better technology to make one 's life more comfortablePeople in current era are described as demanding or having high level of life expectancies in another wordThey are expecting better medication healthier food and cleaner environment and so on and so forthHowever this rising life expectancies have become a challenge and also and an achievement in the population ageingPeople 's average age has become longer compared to the pastFrom one perspective it shows that the medical technology has improved over the years as people now are able to treat different deceasesFrom another perspective there are more and more elder people but less younger ones the increase in population age has weaken the labor force and so onIn my opinion the increase in population age is more a challenge than an achievementSoon after coming into the industrial age human released the weapon and brings up a new technologic eraAn improvement in engineering and medical science had been valued since humanism arisesStudies have shown that the average life span or human being rising gradually over years in the sense that the improvement of global technology in medicine helps human to live longer and enjoyed the world even moreIn spite of that people should aware that the power of science is not almighty life will still go to their last page without revelationSince not all of the human being is going to be a doctor people relies the skills of treatment of doctors and hence they start to ignore the maintenance of their own healthPopulation ageing is a global phenomenon that arises in both developed and developing countriesAverage life span rise from years old in s to over years old in sIn the social science report last year this number will further increase to years old in s due to the advance medical technology and better living standardIn Watt renovated the steam machine which increases the efficiency of the fuelThis activity can be marked as the start of the first technology revolutionAs the technology develops faster and faster during years people not only enjoy more and more materials but also more and more health care which provides convenience in our daily lifeThis significantly raised people 's average life expectancyHowever as the life expectancy of people rises population ageing problem becomes more and more severe as a global phenomenonStudies have shown that the current average life span is overProjections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at to annuallyAs the rise of life expectancies can be interpreted as a measure standard of the pace of technology development it can be seen an achievement of human beingHowever as the energy and resources use up more and more adult people without sufficient power to produce crowd on earth will aggravate the ageing problem so the rise of life expectancies can also be seen as a challengeIn modern world many global issues have been appeared like global warming concept of earth village and populationNowadays population aging is becoming a problem especially in the developed countriesNow in Singapore we can feel that there are more old people than young people if you go to ChinatownPopulation ageing also has brought us a question on whether we should raise life expectancies it is challenging also can get some achievementNowadays population aging has become a more global phenomenonSubsequently a lot of problems regarding to it are arisingRising life expectancies is an achievement because it is an evidence of progress of modern medical technology and meanwhile it is a challenge because it can incur the problem of lacking work force or too large populationPopulation ageing is a phenomenon observed exclusively in advanced civilizationsIt requires at least three conditions to happen advanced health care system reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizensHowever when it happens it is hard to deny that it brings problems such as increased expenses and reduced labors to the societyThe weak is meat and the strong eat it does not apply nowadaysThe advance technology saves lots of lives which should never come to this world or should pass awayFor people this is an achievement but for nature it changes its rule and cycle which is a big challenge faced by human beingAs with the world is becoming more and more advanced people are leading a more and more comfortable lifeMoreover the life expectancies have also been raised due to the developing of the economyHowever while we are enjoying the fruits carried be the development of the economy we are also facing a global problem population ageingThere is no doubt that this problem has become more and more serious which have gradually influenced the tendency of the population as well as the source allocationTherefore the rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievementRising life expectancies is an achievement because it clearly demonstrates that overall quality of life is increasing in both developed and developing countriesHowever it is also a challenge because it strains both society and the environmentAt the present time people are more concerned about their healthThere are better health care systems to let people check their physical condition regularly and more and more people choose organic food and eat balanced diet to make them healthierAs a result the current average life span is over worldwide nowBy projections of the United Nations it is shown that population aged more than is increasing at to in the developed and developing countries respectivelyThe rising life expectancy is a big achievement of human beingsHowever as there are only limited space and resource on earth rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all the people worldwideWith the development of the modern society people lives longerStatistics shows that worldwide the average life expectancy at birth wasyears for according to CIA World FactbookIn the developed countries like Japan and Switzerland the life expectancy can be as high as more thanNormally people will regard the extended life expectation as an achievement and usually use such data as a measure of the development of the countriesHowever as the population is ageing the challenges such as increased medical cost and shortage of workforce are also realizedIn a nut shell rising life expectancies can be considered both an achievement and a challengeThe population ageing is now a heated expression in individuals' livesThese two words can be seen from various media and assessments of this social trend are of great numberWhen mentioning about the population ageing media always consider it as a social problemIt is deniable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems but in the same time it is also a symbol of improvementTherefore population ageing should be considered both a challenge and an achievementFollowing are the more specific explanationsRising Life Expectancies Not Only an Achievement But Also a ChallengePopulation ageing seems to be an achievement when it first happenedIn the old times people could easily lose their life due to hunger disease government war or something elseAfter a country was just founded some immature policy leaded to a nationwide hungerMillions of people could not find food to eat and ended up eating all the trees and grass which could be seenThere was everywhere wandering people trying to find foodSome people even eat their own dead childrenThere was a saying which says that hunger can bring people back to animalsInfectious disease is also a life killerNot long from now SARS as blurry as it is attacked people all around the worldSince no one knew about this disease before it spread around the whole world before human taking actionThe spreading speed was so fast that plenty of people died before knowing about itAn atmosphere of death covered the whole worldThe expression of desperation can be seen everywhereThe war kills a lot of people which is not doubtfulAfter going through the WW and WW the population on the earth got much fewer
